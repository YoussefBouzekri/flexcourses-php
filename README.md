# Flexcourses PHP project
this is the project I made (still working on it for the moment) while taking [this](flexcourses.com/php-intensive) great PHP course provided by flexcourses. while doing this I learned how to use:
- basic php... stuff (functions, loops etc..)
- OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
- using MYSQL & PHPMyAdmin
- integrate both PHP and SQL together.
- make secure contact forms and send mail using PHP
